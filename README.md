# SG-Waste-Recycling-Effect
My first project after I went to explore the usage of Python for Data Visualization.

This Python-based DV project aims to analyze and visualize the resource conservation and recycling rates of different waste types in Singapore. Utilizing the "Resource Conservation Recycling Rate by Waste Type" dataset from data.gov.sg, the project provides insights into Singapore's overall recycling landscape. By leveraging Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, the project cleans, preprocesses, and transforms the data for visualization. The resulting visualizations highlight recycling rates over time and enable comparisons between various waste types. The project's objective is to enhance understanding of Singapore's waste recycling efforts, monitor progress, and identify potential areas for waste management strategy improvements.

By analyzing and visualizing recycling rates, this project empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions and promote sustainable waste management practices. It offers valuable insights into Singapore's recycling performance and trends, helping stakeholders understand the effectiveness of waste management policies. By identifying areas for improvement, stakeholders can take proactive measures to enhance recycling rates and contribute to a greener environment. Through data visualization, this project fosters a deeper understanding of Singapore's waste recycling landscape, supporting informed decision-making and facilitating positive changes in waste management practices.
